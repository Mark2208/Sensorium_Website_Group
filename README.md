# Sensorium Website Group Training Exercise

To make sure we're all confident when we start proper development, I've made this exercise to introduce and test Github's features. It shouldn't take more than a few minutes to complete and please provide any feedback.

I've never used Github like this myself, so hopefully the 'newbie' perspective works to an advantage here.

OBJECTIVES:
=

The objective of this exercise is to try out Github's Collaboration features, which I can't do alone, and hopefully answer some key questions on Version Control Systems for everyone by working on sample C++ files:

**How does Github react and notify us to external commits?**

When someone else commits code to the origin, I want to verify how github lets everyone know, and how it enforces changes to local files. Basically, 'Who is informed of what, and how.'

**What happens when overwriting or tampering with someone else's code? Does it notify the appropriate person(s)?**

A big question in terms of collaboration.

**How do the Branches merge; how is the source code affected, and what are the permissions?**

An extension of the previous question, I want to know what exactly is meant by 'merging'.

These are just some concerns I want to have addressed, and I will post my findings to you after the exercise. Of course, you will get some first-hand
experience as well; what's important is that everyone learns from trial and feedback.

INSTRUCTIONS:
=

Download Github Desktop, it simplifies things a LOT: https://desktop.github.com/

This is the Origin page:  https://github.com/Mark2208/Sensorium_Website_Group

Setup Github Destkop, login and clone the repository to an empty folder.

 
**So what do you need to do?**

I have created two 'training' branches, 1 and 2 assigned to you

1 - Cian, Kyle

2- Jay, Aiden, Alex

1> On Github Desktop, make sure your 'Current branch' is set to your assigned one

[**BRANCH SWITCHING**: When you switch branches, you'll notice that the contents of your local folder changes automatically accordingly. Pretty cool!]

In your respective branches, you must:

2> Create a text file, renamed with your first name. In it, simply post the line '[Yourname] was here'.

3> Open the tester.cpp file. Scroll down to the main(), and uncomment your name accordingly. Since this may cause some conflict, 
I'm guessing github will give you a warning of some sort. Again, I myself have no clue of what's going to happen so any feedback is much appreciated.

(Apologies for using C++ files, I wasn't sure how to competently test websites).

4> Remember to commit the changes to your branch on Github Desktop. [**COMMITING**: I found that Github likes to track EVERYTHING you do, and there's no 'Clear History' button. Basically, try to avoid 'small' commits in the future to prevent clutter and be very sure before you commit.]

That's pretty much all you guys need to do, and I'll take it from there. If you have time, I recommend doing the following yourself after I'm done for the experience.

So what will I do?
=

Basically just tampering with the files to see what happens.

1> I'll be editing/deleting your txt files to check for github warnings/errors/feedback.
 
2> I'll be merging the two branches to check how github handles conflicts (Will it comment/uncomment all lines?) and permissions 
(will it ask you before merging?)

3> I'll periodically build the file to check progress. If you want to do it yourself, let me know if you need instructions 

After I'm done, I'll publish my results, and you may then use the branches as a sort of Playground to test things out yourselves.

Thanks for your co-operation!
